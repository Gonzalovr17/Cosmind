Built with ðŸ§°
- three.js / react-three-fiber for 3D rendering and scene management.
- React for UI and app state.
- drei helpers for orbit controls, loaders, and simple geometry.
- Plain CSS and small utility classes.
- Small JS modules for state, timers, and prompts.

Getting started â€” run a release (recommended)
- Visit the Releases page and download the asset that matches your platform: https://github.com/Gonzalovr17/Cosmind/releases
- After download, run the file you grabbed. The release bundle contains the compiled app and a small launcher.
- If the release is a zip or tarball, extract it then run the executable inside.

Local dev setup
- Clone the repo.
- Install dependencies with your package manager of choice.
- Start a dev server and open the app in the browser.

Quick commands (replace with your toolchain)
- Install: `npm install`
- Start dev server: `npm start`
- Build for production: `npm run build`

Run tips
- Use `reduced-motion` mode on devices where motion causes discomfort.
- Use the spacebar to play/pause a micro-session.
- Use arrow keys to switch scenes.
- The app saves last-used scene and settings to local storage.

Design and interaction
- Each micro-session runs 30â€“90 seconds.
- Visuals rely on low-frequency motion and soft color palettes.
- Interactions focus on single-key commands and small gestures.
- Audio cues use gentle tones. You can toggle sound in settings.

Accessibility and inclusion
- Provide a reduced motion toggle.
- Provide high-contrast theme.
- Ensure all controls work with the keyboard.
- Provide text alternatives for non-text elements and simple ARIA attributes.

Performance tips
- Cap frame rate to 60 or 30 for low-power devices.
- Use baked low-poly geometry for simple scenes.
- Reuse textures and limit lights for mobile builds.
- Use three.js instancing for repeated objects.

Contributing
- Open an issue for ideas or bugs.
- For features, create a short proposal with a user flow and mock.
- Fork, branch from main, and open a pull request with tests or a short demo.
- Keep changes small and focused. Prefer minimal API surface and low bundle impact.

Testing
- Add unit tests for utilities.
- Add lightweight visual checks for scene states.
- Manual test across desktop and mobile breakpoints.
- Verify keyboard navigation and reduced-motion mode.

Roadmap
- Add short guided meditations with simple voice prompts.
- Add micro-social mode: share short status or leave a sticker.
- Add timed focus mode to chain multiple micro-sessions.
- Add analytics opt-in to measure session counts and durations.

FAQ
